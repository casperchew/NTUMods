CC0001,Inquiry & Communication in an Interdisciplinary World,2,,"AB0601, HW0105, HW0106, HW0111, HW0128, HW0188, HW0209","Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein & Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate."

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing. The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education."
CC0006,"Sustainability: Society, Economy & Environment",3,,,"Sustainability stresses the importance of future development to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This concept is a culmination of economic, environmental, and social discourse throughout the last few decades. The United Nations (UN) declared a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) with the aim to promote ?a more sustainable world through different forms of education, training and public awareness activities?. This provides an opportunity to reconsider approaches undertaken to address global challenges. It is imperative that pedagogical directions for higher education institutions address the foundations of sustainable development across different disciplines due to its complex and multi-faceted nature that encompasses a full spectrum of socio-economic-environmental issues. As such, this course aims to stimulate critical thinking, curiosity, and the ability to structure and synthesise knowledge through the lens of sustainability. Learning will be reinforced by concrete case studies with a focus on topics such as resource management, pollution, responsible consumption, and climate change. The course will require systematic analyses of major current sustainability challenges from the perspectives of society, economy, and the environment, and look at how we can promote a more sustainable world through choices and actions, as individuals, societies, nations, and as a global community.

Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case.

SC4025,Developing Data Products,3,"Study Year 3 standing
MH2500 & SC1015",,"Data products are products whose principal thrust is to use data to facilitate certain end goals. These products may exhibit varied levels of complexity, spanning from being raw and derived data, intelligence and services derived from or driven by data, enabled by algorithmic and statistical tools such as machine learning. In many data products, the role of data can be subtle and the overall product may be composed of other modules, which could be more prominent in appearance. The scope of this course is confined to the exploration of the life-cycle of typical data products that deploy data-science dominantly or exclusively. We will deconstruct individual components across the full stack: ranging from data acquisition, wrangling and storage, testing, validation, and refinement - spanning exploratory analysis, issues of visualization and presentation, and application of machine learning techniques for decision support, anomaly detection and recommendation systems. We will explore this course with hands-on examples, illustrating how some data products utilize only a subset of these components, while others deploy the wider gamut. This course will also expose techniques to handle various kinds of data on their own and in conjunction, e.g., natural language data, datetime and timeseries, geoseries and graph data; the underlying systems and algorithms to support, analyze and learn using such data to build data products. Overall, in this course, we will describe several fundamental principles, and we will illustrate them in action using hands-on examples and tools. The choice of algorithms and software packages will be representative but not exhaustive. As such, the detailed description of course content uses 'e.g.,' to give possible indicative instances, but the actual delivery of the course may choose other tools, programming languages, frameworks and examples (including or excluding the indicative instances). Furthermore, the instantiation of tools and examples could vary over time, based on practical considerations, e.g., maturity and popularity of the tools among practitioners. The course will be delivered inter-mixing live lectures and hands-on exercises blended with some parts of the lectures offered in pre-recorded TEL format and curated reading materials."
