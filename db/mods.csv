CC0001,Inquiry & Communication in an Interdisciplinary World,,"AB0601, HW0105, HW0106, HW0111, HW0128, HW0188, HW0209","Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein & Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, \'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.\' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that \'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing\' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate."

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this \'flourishing life\' in different ways, be it through improving one\'s physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a \'good life\' contribute to one\'s overall functioning is critical to one\'s healthy wellbeing. The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education."
CC0006,"Sustainability: Society, Economy & Environment",,,"Sustainability stresses the importance of future development to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This concept is a culmination of economic, environmental, and social discourse throughout the last few decades. The United Nations (UN) declared a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) with the aim to promote ?a more sustainable world through different forms of education, training and public awareness activities?. This provides an opportunity to reconsider approaches undertaken to address global challenges. It is imperative that pedagogical directions for higher education institutions address the foundations of sustainable development across different disciplines due to its complex and multi-faceted nature that encompasses a full spectrum of socio-economic-environmental issues. As such, this course aims to stimulate critical thinking, curiosity, and the ability to structure and synthesise knowledge through the lens of sustainability.
